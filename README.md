# A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance

# Classic and sequential A/B testing analysis

performming data exploration to count unique values of categorical variables, make
histogram, relational, and other necessary plots to help understand the data. For
each of the plots you produce, write a description of what the plot shows in
markdown cells.

performming hypothesis testing: apply the classical p-value based algorithm and the
sequential A/B testing algorithm for which a starter code is provided.
    -Are the number of data points in the experiment enough to make a reasonable
     judgement or should the company run a longer experiment? Remember that
     running the experiment longer may be costly for many reasons, so you should
     always optimize the number of samples to make a statistically sound decision.
    -What does your A/B testing analysis tell you? Is brand awareness increased for
      the exposed group?
